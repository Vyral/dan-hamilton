We’re so lucky to have worked with so many great clients here in Greenville. It has allowed our team to grow and it has allowed our agents to form some fantastic relationships with our clients. We recently caught up with a few of these great clients, and here’s what they had to say about working with us:

“I was up here on vacation around Christmas time visiting my daughter. I liked the area, and started looking online at some houses. Some way or another, I got onto your website and was looking at homes. I went back to Florida, thought about it, then decided I wanted to move. I got back in touch with Carissa and was able to buy the house without even having to come up. I just had conversations with her explaining what I wanted.”

“This is the third home I’ve sold with Hamilton & Co. and they’re exceptional. Every time I’ve put a house up with them, it has sold very fast for the price I wanted.”

“You couldn’t go wrong working with Dan Hamilton and the entire team. I’m very satisfied and I’m looking forward to closing last Wednesday. I think my house was on the market for a total of three weeks. They’re exceptional.”

“I made one trip up here to take a look at a house and make an offer on a home that somebody ended up outbidding me for. I couldn’t come back right away, but within a couple of weeks, Carissa found the house. She did all the leg work while I was in Florida selling my house. I closed on Thursday in Florida, and closed on my new home on Friday in South Carolina.”

To hear all of the great things our clients have had to say about us, make sure to watch the full video above. In the meantime, if you have any questions for us or want to know more about how we can help you accomplish all of your real estate goals, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
