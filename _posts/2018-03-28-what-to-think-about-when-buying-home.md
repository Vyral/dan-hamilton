Buying a home in your 20s and 30s is much different than buying a home for retirement. When purchasing a home for your retirement years, there are a few special considerations to keep in mind.

When you’re retiring, your choice of home will likely be a more practical reflection of your lifestyle and needs. There are three L’s I recommend retirement-age homebuyers keep in mind:

**1. Location.** When you’re older, this ever-important aspect becomes even more critical. It is important for retirement-age buyers to consider whether the home they’re looking at is nearby to family, shopping areas, and more. If transportation is an issue, location will be especially crucial.

**2. Level.** One-level living will really become ideal as you get older. Back pain, knee pain, and general mobility issues all become more common as we age. So, a one-level living situation is certainly something to think about.


**3. Lifestyle.** Before choosing any particular home, consider whether it will suit your lifestyle. Retirement communities often limit your control over exterior aspects of the home, as well as the activities you can engage in while living there. Be sure to keep lifestyle in mind before making your move.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
