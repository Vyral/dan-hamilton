Today I have some great information about the areas in and around Greenville. I am going to highlight two major areas today. The first is Simpsonville.

In the last two years, we have seen homes appreciate by around 7% in Simpsonville, which is great news for homeowners. This means that if you bought a home two or three years ago, you could sell it for 10% to 15% more than you bought it for potentially.

When you are looking at home values, there are really only a few things that determine what a home is worth to a homebuyer:

**1. Condition**
**2. Location**
**3. Competition**
**4. Timing**

If you listen to our radio show on Saturday mornings, you would know that May is the perfect time to sell your house. We generally see about a 6% increase in home values during the month of May. If you have been thinking about selling, let us know and we can develop a great plan of action.

How does our market look right now compared to last year? Last year at this time, we sold 4,419 homes. This year, we have sold 3,812. Thatâ€™s a decrease of about 607 homes. Inventory remains incredibly low and there are a lot of buyers who need homes to move into. However, there are not as many sellers. With such high demand, prices are going to continue to go up.

Now is a great time to enter the market so if you have any questions about selling your home or about the real estate market in general, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
