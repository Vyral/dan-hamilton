Within our Greenville real estate market, there are a number of smaller communities that each have unique market conditions. Today, we’ll be talking about Greer.

The downtown area of Greer is so charming. There’s actually a rule against buildings being more than three stories high. I definitely recommend visiting this community if you haven’t already.

If you already live in Greer, today’s market update might be of interest to you. It’s actually a great time to sell.

The average home price in Greer is $201,000, thanks to an appreciation rate of 7% or 8% over the last couple of years. Also, 2,016 homes have sold in Greer in the past two years.

Another interesting point is that, currently, the number of interested buyers outweighs the number of available homes. The number of homes for sale in Greer today is 8% down compared to this time last year. The number of homes sold, however, is up 25% year over year.

On top of selling quickly, homes in Greer are also selling for about 98% of list price. Of the ones that sold in February alone, 72 sold without any drop in price. Overall, right now is an amazing time to sell in Greer.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
