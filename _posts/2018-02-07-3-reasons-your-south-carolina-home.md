If your home hasn’t sold yet, it could be because of one of these three reasons: price, condition, or marketing.

Are you trying to sell your home, but you’re just not having any luck?

 At this time of year, if your home has been on the market for a while and it isn’t selling, it’s probably one of three reasons why.

The first is price. You can’t change your neighborhood or your location, but you can change your price. We all have a feeling of what our home might be worth, but we test the price to make sure that we’re in the market and not just on the market.

When determining the asking price for you home, you have to consider what other homes around you have sold for. People have emotional attachments to their home. You may think, “Well, my kids grew up here, and we replaced the roof for $5,000.” Other buyers won’t care about that.

Instead, you need to look at the last six months of comparable sales in your area. In this market, you really have to look at the homes you are competing against and what other buyers are looking at in this market.

If your home isn’t selling, another thing you’ll want to look at is the condition of your home. Your home needs to be in the best condition possible for your price point. Buyers will come in, look at different things that need to be done to the home, and start discounting $5,000 here and $5,000 there from their asking price. Before you know it, they are making a lowball offer.

Your home needs to be in great condition. Take care of repairs and make upgrades so your home doesn’t feel like it’s stuck in 1988.

You also need to market your home properly. Just like a builder puts their best foot forward with model homes, you need to put your best foot forward with your home. Declutter, depersonalize, and take top-notch listing photos. Staging your home will help buyers envision what the property will look like once they are living there.

 So, if your home has been on the market for a while, take a look at your price, the condition of your home, and your marketing. What can be improved to help your home sell?

In today’s market, buyers need to be prepared to make an offer at that first showing, especially in certain price points where the market is more competitive. Some buyers do like to come back and bring some other friends or family members to look at the home before making a decision, but again, the market is a little too competitive for that.

Inventory is even lower than it was at this point last year. There are very few homes available on the market. We have buyers who are ready and willing to purchase a property. In fact, some of them are living in temporary housing, so they are ready to move into a home right now.

We need more homes to come on the market, because demand is higher than supply right now.

That said, today’s buyers are very educated, which is why you need to make sure that your property is properly prepared for the market.

If you have any other questions about selling a home in today’s market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
