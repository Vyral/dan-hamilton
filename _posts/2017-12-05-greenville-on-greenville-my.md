I recently talked to Matt McCulley from Greenville on Greenville about starting the first Keller Williams in South Carolina, the future of our market, and more.

I recently sat down with Matt McCulley from Greenville on Greenville to discuss why I got involved in real estate and how I started the first Keller Williams in South Carolina.

 Greenville has a very traditional real estate market. When we started the first Keller Williams in the state of South Carolina, we were up against some very old firms. However, I saw that Keller Williams could bring about a real paradigm shift in real estate.

Matt and I also discuss the future of the Greenville real estate market, what challenges we’ll face, and more. To hear our full conversation, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q2TV4VOEfsI" target="_blank">check out this video</a>.
