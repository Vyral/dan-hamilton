Today I have some great tips for you on how to integrate your dog into your new home. We are seeing a lot more people come to Greenville with their animals. Getting a dog acclimated to a new place can be almost as stressful as moving itself. Here are some tips to help make things easier:

**1. Set some boundaries.** You can do this by getting a crate and not allowing the dog to go into certain areas or onto certain furniture.

**2. Be consistent.** No matter what you choose to do, animals love consistency. If you are consistent in your behavior towards them, they will be consistent with their behavior too.

**3. Get a good vacuum.** This will help keep the house clean and avoid as much chaos as possible with shedding pets.
