  - quote: We had very good service. We were able to get the house and close on in only about a month and a half or so. Greg was always willing to take us to look at houses at a drop of a hat. We were very pleased and we thought that they are a good team

  - quote: We found the house we wanted. We actually bought two houses with Hamilton and Company. The first one was a residential home, and the second an income property. We found the income property at the last minute and Nathan managed to show it to us within a few hours. He made sure that we saw what we wanted to see!

  - quote: The results that we got when we worked with Hamilton & Company were really great! We ended up getting a house that we love! Our Realtor helped us through the negotiations between us and the seller and he hung in there when we were getting discouraged. Any email or phone call was always returned promptly and with the answer we needed. Hamilton & Company was really exceptional the whole time!

  - quote: Angie Bowbliss was the agent that we worked with and she gave me a lot of ideas and was very professional. She’d always call me and let me know how things were going. If I called her and didn’t reach her, she’d call me right back as soon as she was able. Angie just did a great job of going through the negotiations and seeing everything through.

  - quote: We knew our house would be a hard sell because it was a custom built home. When you build something to suit yourself, it doesn’t necessarily suit someone else but Hamilton & Company was really good at advertising, showing the house, and ultimately selling it. All the men and women that we talked to and dealt with were very receptive to what I had to say and they sold my house!

  - quote: When I found the house, Greg was able to go do a video walk through for me since I was out of state. I flew in, made an offer, and everything was super easy. They were accommodating to my schedule since I was out of state and were able to help me get a timely offer in. They were just super helpful!

  - quote: I worked with Nathan Luginbill and he was very instrumental in finding us our new home, which we’re moving into tomorrow! Their closing coordinator was also extremely helpful. For me being from out of state, there were some things that were done a little differently than they were in New Jersey. If I had a question, she responded immediately and if she didn’t know the answer she would still respond to me and then find out the answer. She was absolutely awesome through the entire process and I don’t think everything would have went as well without her!

  - quote: The listings process went very smoothly and it was sold in a very quick time so I am very pleased. The closing coordinator with Hamilton & Company was very helpful to me in communicating with the closing attorney so we thought everything was good!
